# COLUMBS-LAW APPLICATIONS IN REAL WORLD
## Real-World Use Case:

In the Vande Bharat Express communication system, the coaxial transmission lines that connect the rooftop antenna to the router depend on precise electric field control between the inner conductor and the outer shield.

The electric field (E) inside the coaxial cable arises from opposite charges on these conductors.

According to Coulomb’s Law, the force and field distribution determine:

The capacitance per unit length (C) of the cable

The characteristic impedance (Z₀ = √(L/C)), which must be 50 Ω for minimal reflection

If charge distribution (and hence the electric field) isn’t uniform, impedance mismatch occurs — leading to signal reflection (high VSWR) and poor internet quality.

Thus, Coulomb’s Law directly influences how designers choose:

Conductor spacing

Dielectric material (εr)

Cable geometry

All to maintain proper electrostatic field strength for stable data transmission.
