## Application of Coulomb’s Law in the Vande Bharat Express Communication System

## 1.Introduction:
The Vande Bharat Express, India’s flagship high-speed train, represents a major step toward advanced smart rail technology. Designed and built under the “Make in India” initiative, this train not only achieves impressive speeds of up to 180 km/h, but also integrates cutting-edge communication and networking systems to enhance passenger experience, safety, and operational efficiency.

A key feature of the Vande Bharat Express is its onboard communication network, which enables real-time internet access, train control, surveillance, and infotainment. The system seamlessly connects passengers, crew, and control centers using 4G/5G cellular, satellite, and Wi-Fi technologies.

At the heart of this system are transmission lines and RF (Radio Frequency) components—such as coaxial cables, microstrip lines, and antennas—that ensure reliable, high-speed signal transmission even when the train is moving through tunnels, rural areas, or switching between base stations.

By applying principles of transmission line theory—including impedance matching, reflection coefficient, and VSWR—engineers minimize signal loss and electromagnetic interference (EMI). This guarantees that passengers can enjoy uninterrupted internet, while train operators maintain constant communication and safety monitoring throughout the journey.

Thus, the communication system of the Vande Bharat Express showcases how modern RF engineering and transmission line applications play a vital role in delivering smooth, high-speed connectivity to one of the world’s fastest-growing railway networks.

## 2. System Overview: 
## In Coaxial Transmission Lines
Inside a coaxial cable, the inner conductor carries a positive charge and the outer shield carries an equal negative charge.According to Coulomb’s Law, these opposite charges create an electric field (E) between the conductors.The capacitance per unit length (C)The signal propagation velocityThe characteristic impedance (Z₀) of the cableBy controlling the distance (r) and the dielectric constant (ε) between conductors, engineers ensure perfect impedance matching (50 Ω) — reducing reflection and ensuring high-quality internet signals inside the train.

In the Vande Bharat Express communication system, the coaxial transmission lines that connect the rooftop antenna to the router depend on precise electric field control between the inner conductor and the outer shield.

The electric field (E) inside the coaxial cable arises from opposite charges on these conductors.

According to Coulomb’s Law, the force and field distribution determine:

The capacitance per unit length (C) of the cable

The characteristic impedance (Z₀ = √(L/C)), which must be 50 Ω for minimal reflection

If charge distribution (and hence the electric field) isn’t uniform, impedance mismatch occurs — leading to signal reflection (high VSWR) and poor internet quality.

Thus, Coulomb’s Law directly influences how designers choose:

Conductor spacing

Dielectric material (εr)

Cable geometry

All to maintain proper electrostatic field strength for stable data transmission.
